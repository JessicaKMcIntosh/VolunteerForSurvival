# Volunteer For Survival (VTS) Cointributing Guidelines

This is a personal project to write a text adventure survival horror game.
I'm just one woman working on this in my spare time.

## Coding Style

The Coding style follows that of the Inform 6 Library source.

The following deviations are made:

* Two spaces for indention.
* Routine variables on a separate line. Or separate lines as required.

The general idea is to be as clear as possible.
We all have large monitors now so long names, using vertical space and comments are encouraged.

## All contributions are welcome.

If you have anything to contribute do so in the way easiest for you.
Hoever you want to contribute please be clear and spell things out.
If you wan to contribute code please follow the existing style.
Examples are:

* Add a comment to the [Suggestions Thread](https://github.com/JessicaKMcIntosh/VolunteerForSurvival/discussions/2).
