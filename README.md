# Volunteer For Survival (VTS) - A survival horror text adventure game

Itâ€™s been five years since the aliens invaded earth. We got an early warning of their approach so we were prepared. Shelters were built to house people during the conflict. Unfortunately, due to hubris, the world governments expected to defeat the aliens quickly. As a result the shelters were only intended to last for a decade. Thanks to overcrowding, the supplies have nearly run out. For the past year volunteers have been sent out to collect supplies. You are only the latest.

Welcome to Vololtol city.

Can you survive the alien wasteland and make it back to the shelter?

VTS is a survival horror text adventure game. You are tasked with finding supplies to keep the shelter going.

## Playing Volunteer For Survival

Playing VTS Online:

Volunteer For Survival has been uploaded to <https://borogove.io/>.
It is currently private, but will be made public when the game is playable.\

Playing VTS on Unix:

* It is likely your Linux/Unix distribution already has a Z-Machine interpreter available.
* See the following URL for Unix Z-Machine interpreters.\
  <https://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/unix.html>

Playing VTS on Windows:

* See the following URL for Windows Z-Machine interpreters.\
  <https://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/windows.html>
* Frotz is a very good interpreter.\

## Development

VTS is written in the Inform 6 language created by Graham Nelson.

The inspiration for VTS came from a video about PSX/PS1 era horror games.\
<https://youtu.be/z4vtcXVPhbQ?si=ldy6Ie5yHbjiqfTm>

VTS is being developed with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Windows.

### Coding style

The Coding style follows that of the Inform 6 Library source.

The following deviations are made:

* Two spaces for indention.
* Routine variables on a separate line. Or separate lines as required.

## Compiling Volunteer For Survival

### Compiling with Docker

The build process will attempt to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) if installed.
The build script will create a new image `vts:0.0`.
This image uses Debian stable and installs the packages `frotz` `inform6-compiler`.
Using Docker greatly simplifies the process and is the recommended method.

Compiling outside of Docker will be depreciated once I test it under Linux.

### Compiling under Windows

The files required are included in the subdirectory `inform6`.

* Run the script `build.bat`. \
  `build.bat`
* The build script has builtin help.\
  `build.bat help`
* Tests can be run using the `test` parameter.\
  `build.bat tests`

### Compiling under Unix

Linux generally has the inform6 package available for install.
It is recommended to install the package.

* WARNING: Do not use the old Inform 6.31 version under Linux.
  If this is the only version available for your version of Linux then
  download the latest version and compile from source.

To buld VTS:

* Run the build.sh file \
  `bash ./build.sh`

There is a version of the inform compiler for Linux included.
To use this version edit the file `build.sh` and see the variable `INFORM_COMPILER`.

To install the latest version of the compiler from source:

* Download the Inform 6 compiler source .tar.gz file from:
  <http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/compilers/inform6/source/>
  As of writing this the current file is: inform-6.41-r1.tar.gz
* Extract, build and install the Inform 6 compiler.
  tar -xzf inform-6.41-r1.tar.gz
  cd inform-6.41-r1
  make
  make install
* Change to the VTS folder and update the file `build.sh`.
  Change the comment for the variable `INFORM_COMPILER`.


### Compiling using Visual Studio Code

Using the included build shell or batch files:

* Run the task `Build VTS Game`. This is the default build task.
* The task `Run VTS Tests` will build and run the tests. This is the default test task.
* Run the task `Build VTS Game DEBUG` to compile VTS with DEBUG enabled.

Using the 'Inform 6' extension:

* Install the Extension 'Inform 6' for syntax highlighting.\
  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=natrium729.inform-6>
* Optionally install the Extension 'IF Player' to play the game in VS code.\
  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=natrium729.if-player>
* Follow the steps for 'Compiling under Windows' to download the compiler and Library.
* If you are on Linux/Unix update the file `.vscode/settings.json` and remove `.exe` from the setting `inform6.inform6Path`.
