# Volunteer For Survival (VTS) - A survival horror text adventure game

Itâ€™s been five years since the aliens invaded earth. We got an early warning of their approach so we were prepared. Shelters were built to house people during the conflict. Unfortunately, due to hubris, the world governments expected to defeat the aliens quickly. As a result the shelters were only intended to last for a decade. Thanks to overcrowding, the supplies have nearly run out. For the past year volunteers have been sent out to collect supplies. You are only the latest.
