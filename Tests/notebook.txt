Volunteer For Survival
A survival horror text adventure game.
By Jessica McIntosh <JessicaKMcIntosh AT gmail DOT com>

It's been five years since the aliens invaded earth. We got an early warning
of their approach so we were prepared. Shelters were built to house people
during the conflict. Unfortunately, due to hubris, the world governments
expected to defeat the aliens quickly. As a result the shelters were only
intended to last for a decade. Thanks to overcrowding, the supplies have
nearly run out. For the past year volunteers have been sent out to collect
supplies. You are only the latest.

Welcome to Vololtol city.

Can you survive the alien wasteland and make it back to the shelter?

We need food above all.
Canned food, sealed rations, anything preserved and edible.
Working electronics like laptops, tablets, phones and similar.
Tools are in short supply as well.
Anything else useful you might find go ahead and bring back.

Place items in the box where you woke up for rewards.
Being back enough stuff and you will be allowed to return to the shelter.

Hey there, uh, well, me. They tell me I will not remember anything once I take
this drug. So I need to tell you, or, myself, what we are supposed to be doing.
The drug is going to make me forget everything. I'll just do the short
version. A bad thing happened. We are living in shelters. The, things, out
there are psychic or something. I don't really understand this stuff, I'm just
a janitor. Unfortunately we need food and tech to survive. So us volunteers are
sent out into the world to collect what we need. Basically anything useful,
check the list in your notebook. They gave me what few supplies they can spare,
which frankly isn't much. Just a backpack, some food, a strange radio and a
fucking crowbar. Anyway, they are about to send me out so I'll end this. Oh,
one last thing, they said if I do a good job I'll get my own room, all to
myself. Bye.

I found those things you wanted so you better pay me back.
Some day you need to tell me what the hell a Zork even is.
