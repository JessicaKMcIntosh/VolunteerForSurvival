Volunteer For Survival
A survival horror text adventure game.
By Jessica McIntosh <JessicaKMcIntosh AT gmail DOT com>

It's been five years since the aliens invaded earth. We got an early warning
of their approach so we were prepared. Shelters were built to house people
during the conflict. Unfortunately, due to hubris, the world governments
expected to defeat the aliens quickly. As a result the shelters were only
intended to last for a decade. Thanks to overcrowding, the supplies have
nearly run out. For the past year volunteers have been sent out to collect
supplies. You are only the latest.

Welcome to Vololtol city.

Can you survive the alien wasteland and make it back to the shelter?
